# Background
In this assignment, you will build an interactive dashboard to explore the Belly Button Biodiversity datasetLinks to an external site., which catalogs the microbes that colonize human navels.

The dataset reveals that a small handful of microbial species (also called operational taxonomic units, or OTUs, in the study) were present in more than 70% of people, while the rest were relatively rare.

# Drop Down Menu
- The website provides a "Test Subject ID No." section where users can select from a drop down menu. Clicking on each test subject will display visualizations such as bar, bubbles and gauge graphs.
